Stock Prediction with LSTM Model

Overview

Welcome to my Stock Prediction project, where I utilized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock market trends based on historical data. This project aims to harness the power of deep learning to make informed predictions about future stock prices.

Key Features

LSTM Model: The project leverages LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. This enables the model to learn and understand intricate patterns in stock price movements.


Historical Data: The LSTM model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of historical stock prices. This dataset allows the model to identify trends and patterns, making it capable of making predictions based on past market behavior.


Data Preprocessing: Robust preprocessing techniques have been employed to clean and transform the raw data. This step ensures that the model receives high-quality input, improving its ability to discern meaningful patterns.
